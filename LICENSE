GMK Splitter is a tool for splitting Game Maker's game files
into a tree of .xml and resource files which can later be re-assembled
into a .gmk file. This enables groups of Game Maker users to collaborate
on a project using version control software, or to manually merge
different versions of a game.

GMK Splitter is based heavily on LgmScm by IsmAvatar.
